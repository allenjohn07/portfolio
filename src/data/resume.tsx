    "Full stack developer, Speedcuber",
  summary:
    "Full-stack developer fueled by curiosity, caffeine, and a triple major in Computer Applications, currently based in Calgary, Alberta, where I&apos;m pursuing a diploma in Software Development. I&apos;m diving into the wonders (and occasional frustrations) of TypeScript and Next.js, while also getting started with Python and tackling the easiest problems on LeetCode â€” aiming to one day solve them without a little help from AI. Outside the dev world, I&apos;m usually speed-solving Rubik&apos;s cubes or organizing cube competitions.",
